# ModMove

ModMove is a tiny OS X app that takes my favorite single piece of
[HyperDock](https://bahoom.com/hyperdock/) and does just that.

## Usage

There are 2 things ModMove can do:

1. To move the window under the cursor, hold Control (⌃) and Option (⌥),
   then move the mouse
2. To resize the window under the cursor, hold Control (⌃) and Option
   (⌥) and Shift (⇧), then move the mouse.

With [`cask`](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask):

```sh

```
